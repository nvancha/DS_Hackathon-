# Data Science Project Repository

This repository contains a collection of data science projects created using Colab. Each project is focused on a different dataset and data science challenge, from cardiovascular disease prediction to wind speed forecasting.

## Projects Overview

Each project directory contains Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files) with detailed exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and insights generation.

- **GROUP_11_M6_Fairness_Credit_Scoring_Product**: Analysis of fairness in credit scoring.
- **GROUP_24_M4_Hackathon_Cirrhosis_Product**: Investigative study on cirrhosis.
- **GROUP_4_M5_Hackathon_Wind_speed_prediction**: Wind speed prediction model development.
- **Hackathon_3**: Identify individuals with good credit scores based upon the available predictors.
- **M2_Group4**: Analysis of cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk.
- **M4Hackathon2023_DrugReviews_Reflection**: Analysis of drug reviews and reflections.

## General Guidelines for Each Project

- **Data Preprocessing**: Address missing values, duplicates, outliers, encodings, skewness, scaling, and data imbalance issues.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Provide visualizations and descriptive statistics to understand the data and any noteworthy relationships.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Apply appropriate machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using suitable metrics and validation techniques.
- **Conclusion**: Summarize the key findings, potential impacts, and any recommendations or business insights derived from the analysis.
- **Visualization Requirement**: Ensure a significant portion of visualizations is produced through code for reproducibility.

## How to Use This Repository

- Clone the repository to your local machine or open the notebooks directly in Colab.
- Navigate to the specific project folder to access the Jupyter Notebooks.
- Review the `README.md` file in each project directory for detailed instructions and project-specific information.
